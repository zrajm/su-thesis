@Comment Types of References
@Comment ===================
@Comment
@Comment 'article' -- An article from a journal or magazine.
@Comment Required: author, title, journal, year, volume
@Comment Optional: number, pages, month, doi, note, key
@Comment Extra: day, editor, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     A journal article or comparable. If the “article” referenced to is
@Comment     a special issue of a journal or something else that has editors
@Comment     instead of authors, the 'author' field should be empty and the
@Comment     'editor' field should be used for the editors. If the journal
@Comment     paginates by issue instead of by volume, or when you are referring
@Comment     to a whole special issue, the issue number should be given in the
@Comment     'number' field. In all other cases (including referring to an
@Comment     article within a special issue), the 'number' field must not be
@Comment     used. The 'type' field can be used to denote the type of article,
@Comment     for example, “Letter to the editor”, or “Review of the book
@Comment     \emph{Life in the middle}”.
@Comment
@Comment 'magazine' -- A magazine article.
@Comment Required: author, title, journal, year, volume
@Comment Optional: number, pages, month, day, doi, note, key
@Comment Extra: editor, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment      This is equivalent to 'article'. However, with an 'article', the
@Comment      'month' and 'day' fields should generally not be used, unless
@Comment      there is a compelling reason to use them. For a magazine, the
@Comment      'month', and 'day' (for weeklies) fields are commonly used.
@Comment
@Comment 'newspaper' -- A newspaper article.
@Comment Required: author, title, journal, year, volume
@Comment Optional: number, pages, month, day, doi, note, key
@Comment Extra: editor, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     This is similar to 'article' and 'magazine', except that the pages
@Comment     are formatted a little different, with “pp. 23–49” instead of just
@Comment     “23–49”.
@Comment
@Comment 'book' -- A book with an explicit publisher.
@Comment Required: author/editor, title, publisher, year
@Comment Optional: volume/number, series, address, edition, month, note, key,
@Comment     url
@Comment Extra: doi, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     An entire book. The 'type' field can be used to denote a specific
@Comment     type of item (so generally not strictly a book), e.g., “Brochure”.
@Comment     Similarly, the 'number' field can be used if this is considered
@Comment     useful. This seems quite rare to me, however. It should certainly
@Comment     *not* be used for ISBN numbers and the like.
@Comment
@Comment 'incollection' -- A part of a book having its own title.
@Comment Required: author, title, booktitle, publisher, year
@Comment Optional: editor, volume/number, series, type, chapter, pages, address,
@Comment     edition, month, note, key
@Comment Extra: day, doi, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     An article in a (usually edited) book, or other kind of larger
@Comment     work, except a report, for which the 'intechreport' entry is used.
@Comment     The 'booktitle' field contains the title of the whole collection
@Comment     (book). The 'type' field is currently used to denote the type of
@Comment     article, as with the 'article' reference type, although in some
@Comment     cases, it may be more naturally to let the 'type' field contain the
@Comment     type of the whole work (e.g., CD).
@Comment
@Comment 'techreport' -- A report published by a school or other institution,
@Comment     usually numbered within a series.
@Comment Required: author, title, institution, year
@Comment Optional: type, number, address, month, note, key
@Comment Extra: day, doi, edition, editor, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     A report. This may be a “technical” report such as published by
@Comment     universities, or a report from government organizations or private
@Comment     companies. The 'type' field can be used to indicate what kind of
@Comment     report it is, e.g., “College Board Rep.” or “{DHHS} Publication”.
@Comment     If the 'type' field is missing, the default type “Tech.\
@Comment     Rep.\hbox{}” is used. (The \hbox{} ensures that TEX does not view
@Comment     the period as the end of a sentence, which would insert too much
@Comment     space.) If no type description should be given, '\bibnotype' should
@Comment     be used as the contents of the 'type' field. The 'number' field can
@Comment     be used to give the report number. The organization that published
@Comment     the report should be given in the 'institution' field.
@Comment
@Comment 'intechreport' -- An article in a (usually edited) report.
@Comment Required: author, title, booktitle, institution, year
@Comment Optional: editor, volume/number, series, type, chapter, pages, address,
@Comment     edition, month, note, key
@Comment Extra: day, doi, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     This is more or less a combination of 'incollection' and
@Comment     'techreport'. It uses the same fields as the former to describe the
@Comment     article itself, except 'type', e.g., 'booktitle', which is in this
@Comment     case the title of the entire report, and the same fields as the
@Comment     latter to describe the report. In particular, the 'type', 'number',
@Comment     and 'institution' fields are used for the report.
@Comment
@Comment 'lecture' -- A paper presented at a meeting.
@Comment Extra: address, author, chair, day, doi, englishtitle, howpublished,
@Comment     lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     According to the APA manual, the year and month should be given,
@Comment     but apacite also uses the 'day' field when available. The
@Comment     'symposium' field can be used for the name of the symposium and the
@Comment     'chair' field for the chair of the meeting. The 'howpublished'
@Comment     field should be used to indicate the occasion at which the paper
@Comment     was presented if the 'symposium' field is empty, e.g., “Paper
@Comment     presented at the meeting of the American Professional Society on
@Comment     the Abuse of Children”. It can also be used to give additional
@Comment     information about the symposium if the 'symposium' field is not
@Comment     empty.
@Comment
@Comment 'phdthesis' -- A Ph.D. thesis.
@Comment Required: author, title, school, year
@Comment Optional: type, address, month, note, key
@Comment Extra: doi, edition, englishtitle, howpublished, journal, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     A doctoral dissertation. The school field is used to denote the
@Comment     university for which the thesis was written. The 'type' field can
@Comment     be used for the thesis type, e.g., “PhD thesis”. If it is empty,
@Comment     the default type is used, which is “Unpublished doctoral
@Comment     dissertation” or “Doctoral dissertation”, depending on whether the
@Comment     'journal' field is empty or not.
@Comment
@Comment     If the thesis is abstracted in “Dissertation Abstracts
@Comment     International” or similar, then the 'journal', 'volume', 'number',
@Comment     and 'pages' fields can be used as with journal articles. The 'year'
@Comment     field should denote the year of the “journal”. The 'originalyear'
@Comment     field should be used to denote the year of the original thesis,
@Comment     even if it is the same as the year of the abstract, provided that
@Comment     the original thesis is used, and not the abstract. Then, the
@Comment     'school' field should also be used, and optionally the 'type'
@Comment     field. If only the abstract is used, it should presumably be
@Comment     treated as a journal article.
@Comment
@Comment 'mastersthesis' -- A Master's thesis.
@Comment Required: author, title, school, year
@Comment Optional: type, address, month, note, key
@Comment Extra: doi, edition, englishtitle, howpublished, journal, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     This is equivalent to the 'phdthesis' type, except that the default
@Comment     “unpublished” and “published” 'type's are “Unpublished master’s
@Comment     thesis” and “Master’s thesis”.
@Comment
@Comment 'unpublished' -- A document having an author and title, but not
@Comment     formally published.
@Comment Required: author, title, note
@Comment Optional: month, year, key
@Comment Extra: address, day, doi, editor, englishtitle, howpublished,
@Comment     lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     For unpublished manuscripts and similarly “obscure” material. The
@Comment     'howpublished' field will typically be used to indicate what kind
@Comment     of work is referred to (e.g., “Unpublished manuscript”). The
@Comment     'organization' field can be used to denote the organization in
@Comment     which the document was produced, e.g., “Johns Hopkins University,
@Comment     Center for Social Organization of Schools”. Note that the larger
@Comment     organization should be given first and the department after that.
@Comment     The address (city and state, etc., see the discussion of the
@Comment     'address' field in section 5.2 below) of the organization should be
@Comment     given in the 'address' field, unless it is already mentioned in the
@Comment     name of the organization. Presumably, if the organization is
@Comment     “University of Groningen”, the city name “Groningen” should not be
@Comment     given in the 'address' field, but the country “The Netherlands”
@Comment     should. When both the 'organization' and the 'address' field are
@Comment     available, apacite formats these as “organization, address”. This
@Comment     is different from the usual “address: publisher” form. This
@Comment     behavior cannot explicitly be deduced from the 5th edition, nor
@Comment     from the 4th edition, of the APA manual, but the 3rd edition
@Comment     (American Psychological Association [APA], 1984) gives an explicit
@Comment     example (example 53, p. 131): Gottfredson (1978).
@Comment
@Comment 'manual' -- Technical documentation.
@Comment Required: title
@Comment Optional: author, organization, address, edition, month, year, note,
@Comment     key
@Comment Extra: day, doi, editor, englishtitle, howpublished, lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     This is treated as a 'misc', except that when the 'type' field is
@Comment     empty, it is assumed to be a '\bibcomputersoftwaremanual'. See also
@Comment     the description of the 'type' field below.
@Comment
@Comment 'misc' -- For use when nothing else fits.
@Comment Required: none
@Comment Optional: author, title, howpublished, month, year, note, key
@Comment Extra: address, day, doi, edition, editor, englishtitle, howpublished,
@Comment     lastchecked
@Comment
@Comment     For works that do not fit into the other categories, such as motion
@Comment     pictures, cassette recordings, computer software, etc. The 'type'
@Comment     field can be used to indicate the type of work, and apacite
@Comment     recognizes a few specific types that should be formatted a little
@Comment     differently, see the discussion of the 'type' field below. If the
@Comment     'address' and 'publisher' fields are available, the address and
@Comment     publisher part is formatted as with books. The 'unpublished' and
@Comment     'misc' types are very similar, but there are some differences. For
@Comment     example, 'unpublished' uses the 'organization' field and 'misc'
@Comment     uses the 'publisher' field, and this part is formatted differently.
@Comment     Further, the 'unpublished' type requires 'author', 'editor',
@Comment     'title', or 'type', whereas with 'misc', 'howpublished' takes the
@Comment     first position if these fields are all empty. Finally, as briefly
@Comment     indicated above and discussed in more detail below, 'misc'
@Comment     recognizes some special types in the 'type' field.
@Comment
@Comment 'literal'
@Comment Extra: doi, text
@Comment
@Comment     If the other categories do not format the item correctly, this
@Comment     category can be used. The 'text' field is copied literally to the
@Comment     bibliography. The 'firstkey', 'key', 'year', and possibly
@Comment     'originalyear' and 'translator' fields are necessary to get correct
@Comment     in-text citations. However, I have never needed to use this entry
@Comment     type and I think that 'misc' should also be able to format the
@Comment     entry correctly. Furthermore, the correct placement of 'literal'
@Comment     references in the reference list (alphabetizing, sorting), may be
@Comment     problematic.
@Comment
@Comment =======================================================================
@Comment
@Comment 'booklet' -- A work that is printed and bound, but without a named
@Comment     publisher or sponsoring institution.
@Comment Required: title
@Comment Optional: author, howpublished, address, month, year, note, key
@Comment
@Comment 'inbook' -- A part of a book, usually untitled. May be a chapter (or
@Comment     section, etc.) and/or a range of pages.
@Comment Required: author/editor, title, chapter/pages, publisher, year
@Comment Optional: volume/number, series, type, address, edition, month,
@Comment     note, key
@Comment
@Comment 'conference'/'inproceedings' -- An article in a conference proceedings.
@Comment Required: author, title, booktitle, year
@Comment Optional: editor, volume/number, series, pages, address, month,
@Comment     organization, publisher, note, key
@Comment
@Comment 'proceedings' -- The proceedings of a conference.
@Comment Required: title, year
@Comment Optional: editor, volume/number, series, address, month,
@Comment     publisher, organization, note, key
@Comment
@Comment     These categories are defined by all standard citation styles. They
@Comment     are, however, not needed for the examples in the APA manual. For
@Comment     compatibility, however, they are included and defined as follows:
@Comment     'booklet = proceedings = misc'; 'inbook = inproceedings =
@Comment     incollection'. Kopka and Daly (2004, p. 230) also mention
@Comment     'conference' as being the same as 'inproceedings'; for
@Comment     compatibility, this is now supported in apacite.
