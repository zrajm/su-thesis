  abstract  = {In this article, we describe the form of a subset of mouth
                  gestures in Swedish Sign Language, namely lexically
                  determined, non-morphemic mouth gestures, here referred to as
                  mouth components. We argue that mouth components can be
                  analysed as sequentially ordered combinations of (a small set
                  of) open and closed segments. We also propose a description
                  of the mouth segments in terms of features. Finally, we test
                  the hypothesis that mouth movements borrowed from Swedish are
                  reconstructed according to the native pattern.},
